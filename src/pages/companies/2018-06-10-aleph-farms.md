  Aleph Farms is a cellular agriculture startup based in Ashdod, Israel. Founded
  by Didier Toubia and Dr. Shulamit Levenberg, Aleph Farms was founded in 2017
  to make cultured beef. Through cellular agriculture, Aleph Farms hope to make
  a sustainable, safe, and transparent source of beef. Through a proprietary
  tissue engineering platform, Aleph Farms has found a way to make more
  structured and complex meat products.
