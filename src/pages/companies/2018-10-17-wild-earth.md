  Wild Earth is one of the first startups to use cellular agriculture to produce
  cultured pet food. Founded by Ryan Bethencourt, Ron Shigeta, Abril Estrada,
  and Kristin Wuhrman, Wild Earth offers a sustainable and safer way to help
  feed pets a healthy diet. Wild Earthâ€™s first product is their koji-based dog
  treats.  By using koji, Wild Earth avoids the health risks associated with
  conventional pet food. Wild Earth originally began limited releases of their
  koji-based dog treats in July 2018 and, as of October 2018, are now available
  on their website. They plan to release more pet foods in 2019.
