  At Mission Barns, we are cultivating animal cells to sustainably grow meat
  without the negative impacts of intensive animal agriculture. We start with a
  handful cells from select animals, grow them in a nutrient-rich environment,
  and harvest delicious, savory meat. Working at the convergence of biotech and
  food science, weâ€™re on the path to creating a more sensible food system for
  the world.
