  Based in Tokyo, Integriculture is a Japanese startup that uses cellular
  agriculture to grow cultured meat. Integriculture was founded by Yuki Hanyu as
  a spin-off from the Shojinmeat Project, which Hanyu also founded. The
  Shojinmeat Project is a non-profit that helps people learn more about cultured
  meat and grow their own cultured meat at home in Japan! Through the Shojinmeat
  Project, Hanyu hopes to engage and inform the public about cultured meat and
  its benefits.
