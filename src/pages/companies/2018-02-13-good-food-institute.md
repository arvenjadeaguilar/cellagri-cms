      The work of GFI’s Senior Scientist will expand the frontiers of
      plant-based and clean meat, egg, and dairy technologies until they render
      factory farming obsolete.


      How You Will Make a Difference:

      GFI’s Senior Scientists develop and promote the science of plant-based and
      clean meat, egg, and dairy technologies. As the global experts in this
      sector, they work to ensure that a roadmap exists for plant-based and
      clean alternatives; that the best scientists are engaged in plant-based
      and clean meat, egg, and dairy R&D; and that significant funds are
      directed toward scientific endeavors to transform agriculture away from
      the industrial farming of animals. Working with key academic, nonprofit,
      and industry stakeholders, GFI’s Senior Scientists ensure that plant-based
      and clean alternatives to factory-farmed products dominate the marketplace
      as quickly as possible by:

      - Leading and writing technical analyses of the plant-based and clean
      meat, egg, and dairy industries that culminate in white papers, conference
      presentations, and peer-reviewed articles.

      - Identifying the key areas requiring the most focused research and
      finding researchers to perform that work.

      - Mobilizing funding by meeting with venture capitalists, foundations,
      universities, and others that are interested in putting capital into
      plant-based and clean meat, egg, and dairy technologies.

      - Building GFI’s capacity to serve as a knowledge hub for the industry and
      to guide public discourse around it.

      - Providing technical support, mentoring, and strategic advice to
      entrepreneurs, start-ups, venture capitalists, academic faculty, and
      students on topics such as product development, career changes, business
      design, and process expertise.

      We are seeking smart, thoughtful, and creative self-starters who want to
      push back against climate change, transform industrial animal agriculture,
      and develop healthy and humane foods that are accessible to everyone. GFI
      staff enjoy high levels of autonomy and must be self-motivated, work well
      both independently and in concert with a larger group, and be comfortable
      working with a rapidly evolving and growing team.


      We are currently looking for two Senior Scientists with distinct and
      complementary areas of expertise: one to focus primarily on clean meat,
      eggs, and dairy (with expertise in, e.g., stem cell biology, tissue
      engineering, biochemical engineering, or synthetic biology); and another
      to focus primarily on plant-based products (with expertise in, e.g., plant
      molecular biology, plant genetics, or crop science). Both Senior
      Scientists must also have:

      - A Ph.D. in a relevant scientific field, or the equivalent (e.g. a
      master’s degree plus at least five years of experience in R&D in a
      relevant industry).

      - Exceptional writing.

      - Comfort with public speaking.

      - Experience analyzing scientific literature and conducting literature
      reviews.

      - A proven track record in translating scientific information into formats
      for lay professionals.  

      - Functional understanding of the principles, methods, equipment and
      techniques used in either plant-based or clean meat, egg, and dairy
      research and manufacturing.


      A background in food science or experience working with plant-based or
      clean meat, egg, or dairy companies is a strong plus.

      The Corporate Engagement Department focuses on increasing the
      accessibility and visibility of plant-based alternatives to factory-farmed
      products. By reporting on the state of the industry today, the intern will
      help lay the groundwork for the department’s future efforts to enlist
      corporations in transforming the food system.


      Activities: A group of interns will work on one or more of the following
      projects:

      - Using a predefined rubric, the intern will conduct a second annual
      review of the menus of the top 100 chain restaurants and rank them
      according to breadth and depth of their plant-based entrée openings. Most
      of this research will be conducted online or over the phone, though
      supplemental site visits may be useful. The intern will update a
      spreadsheet with the new ranking based on the rubric.

      - Assist the Corporate Engagement team to develop a marketing plan for
      reaching the hundreds of thousands of restaurants not in the top 100
      ranking to make them aware of the GFI resources available to help them to
      offer more plant-based entrées

      - Update plant-based product database as new products are launched and
      entrée database with innovative plant-based dishes found through online
      research

      - Conduct research on corporations that GFI would like to engage with to
      encourage the production of more plant-based foods

      - Assist with an analysis of the grocery sector, researching names of key
      corporate contacts and identifying opportunities for improvement in
      promoting and selling plant-based foods


      Learning Objectives: The intern will gain experience conducting in-depth
      corporate research, analyzing menus, and organizing projects. They will
      become an expert in the current state of plant-based offerings and will
      play an integral role in the process of encouraging corporations to turn
      their attention to the consumer shift towards plant-based eating.

      There are two purposes of this internship:

      - First, the interns will gather information about research institutions,
      academic researchers, and companies conducting work in adjacent research
      areas (e.g. cell therapy company) who are currently using technologies
      that are applicable to plant-based and clean meat research or food
      technology. Once we know who these researchers and institutions are, we
      can reach out to them to let them know how their current expertise could
      be helpful for advancing the research of plant-based and clean meat. GFI
      may also be able to partner with them to advance clean meat and
      plant-based meat research in their country.

      - Second, the interns will gather information about scientific conferences
      and opportunities in their countries. Once we have this information, we
      can encourage scientists to speak about or submit research papers on clean
      meat and plant-based meat technology and developments.

      - Interns may pick their country of choice assuming it has not already
      been chosen by another intern.


      Activities: The main activities of this internship include internet and
      database research to locate the needed information, followed by
      development of (1) a institution and researcher database and (2) a
      scientific conference database.

      Examples of areas of expertise to search:

      - Bioengineering / Biomedical engineering

      - Chemical engineering

      - Biological sciences

      - Cellular biology

      - Developmental biology

      - Molecular biology

      - Stem cell biology

      - Tissue engineering

      - Bioprocess engineering

      - Food science and nutrition

      - Biochemistry / chemistry

      - Plant science / plant biology / plant engineering

      - Sociology / environmental science / public health (food behavior and
      other food-related studies)


      Deliverables: The end result of this internship will be (1) a database
      listing institutions, academic researchers, and companies who are
      currently using technologies that are applicable to plant-based and clean
      meat research or food technology and (2) a database listing conference
      opportunities. We would also like any recommendations from the interns on
      which academic institutions or research facilities are well respected in
      their countries and areas of expertise.


      Learning Objectives: The primary learning objective is for the intern to
      develop expertise in the transferability of scientific areas of expertise
      to plant-based and clean-meat research and an understanding of the
      scientific market and opportunities in a specific country. They will also
      learn best practices in information management and sharing.

    position: 'International Intern: Science Opportunities'
  - description: >-
      The purpose of this internship will be to support the work of GFI’s Policy
      Department to promote a healthy, humane, and sustainable food supply
      through regulatory and legislative reform. Specifically, we are looking
      for legal help (from interns or fellows) to conduct research into
      regulatory pathways for clean meat in countries outside of the United
      States.


      Activities: The main activities of this internship are: 1) legal research
      into food regulation in a specific jurisdiction outside of the United
      States; and 2) analysis of how clean meat could be brought to market under
      the regulatory framework that currently exists in that jurisdiction.


      Deliverables: The end result of this internship will be a legal research
      memorandum addressing the specific steps that producers should take to get
      approval to bring clean meat to market. Where the law is unclear or
      multiple regulatory pathways are available to clean meat producers, the
      memorandum should provide a compelling analysis of what the best pathway
      forward would be.


      What We’re Looking For: We are looking for smart, highly motivated lawyers
      and law students to help us make a difference. We’re flexible about
      geographic location—you’ll work from home. As with all our positions,
      women, people of color, people with disabilities, and veterans are
      strongly encouraged to apply.


      Learning Objectives: The primary learning objective is for the intern or
      fellow to develop expertise in researching how food is regulated in a
      country outside of the United States and analyzing a novel question of
      law.
