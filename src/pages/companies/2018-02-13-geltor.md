  Geltor is a company that uses cellular agriculture to create animal-free
  gelatin. Founded in 2015 by Alexander Lorestani and Nick Ouzounov, Geltor uses
  yeast to produce the protein collagen via fermentation. Collagen is the main
  component of gelatin, and gelatin is used in a range of products including
  foods, medicine, and cosmetics. Collagen is also the main component of
  leather, and Geltor showed their versatility by making the animal-free
  leather-bound book from jellyfish collagen. Since conventional gelatin is
  extracted from animal bone, skin, and connective tissue, Geltorâ€™s animal-free
  gelatin provides a cleaner and more sustainable way to obtain the same
  product.
