title: Perfect Day Foods
description: >-
  Perfect Day Foods is the first cellular agriculture company to make
  animal-free dairy milk. Founded by Ryan Pandya and Perumal Gandhi in 2014,
  Perfect Day Foods uses yeast to produce real dairy milk proteins via
  fermentation. Combined with plant-based sugars and fats, Perfect Day Food’s
  product is lactose-free and has a longer shelf life than conventional dairy
  milk. Before bringing the product to the market, Perfect Day Foods initially
  plan to sell their product to other businesses who would use it as an
  ingredient in other products.
