description: >
  We are a small group of individuals who enjoy and take great pride in the work
  we do. Nothing is ever completely finished. We are constantly refining,
  improving and finding faster ways of getting things done. Everyday at work is
  an opportunity to test out new technologies and methods. We are constantly
  questioning the status quo and the way things have “always” been done.

  What excites us is building solutions to problems that impact the billions of
  people that go to work everyday. We have an internal list of things we believe
  that can be dramatically improved. Our studio gives us the place to experiment
  and test our assumptions. On the other hand, our capital arm is driven to find
  other entrepreneurs and makers who are out solving similar problems.
