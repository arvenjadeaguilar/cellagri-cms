  Memphis Meats was the first cellular agriculture company to make a cultured
  meatball in February 2016 and the first to make cultured poultry (chicken and
  duck) in March 2017. Through cellular agriculture, Memphis Meats can produce
  real animal meat without requiring to breed, feed, and slaughter animals.
  Founded by Uma Valeti and Nicholas Genovese, Memphis Meats is based in
  Berkeley, California. They hope that their first products will be in the
  market by 2021.
