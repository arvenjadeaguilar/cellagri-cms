  Founded by Dr. Mark Post, MosaMeat was the first cellular agriculture company
  founded to make cultured meat. In 2013, MosaMeat and Post made the first
  cultured beef burger for over $300,000 for a taste-test in London, UK. Post
  believes that cellular agriculture will help us achieve a post-animal economy
  that is critical in achieving a sustainable livestock agricultural system.
