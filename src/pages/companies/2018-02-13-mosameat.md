  Founded by Dr. Mark Post, MosaMeat was the first European cellular agriculture
  company founded to make cultured meat. In 2013, MosaMeat co-founder Dr. Post
  presented the first cultured beef burger for over $300,000 for a taste-test in
  London, UK. Post believes that cellular agriculture will help us achieve a
  post-animal economy that is critical in achieving a sustainable livestock
  agricultural system.
