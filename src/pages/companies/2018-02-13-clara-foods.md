  Clara Foods is a cellular agriculture company that makes animal-free egg
  whites. Founded Arturo Elizondo and David Anchel in 2014, Clara Foods uses
  yeast to produce real egg white proteins via fermentation. Egg white is a
  popular ingredient in many foods, like meringues, macaroons, and other baked
  goods, and an animal-free source of egg white avoids the health risks
  associated with animal agriculture of egg production. Clara Foods initially
  plans to sell their products to other businesses who would us it as an
  ingredient to make other foods.
