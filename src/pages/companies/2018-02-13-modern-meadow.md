title: Modern Meadow
description: >-
  Founded by Andras Forgacs, Modern Meadow is one of the first companies to use
  cellular agriculture to grow animal leather from cell cultures. Instead of
  creating animal skin cells for leather, Modern Meadow focuses on producing the
  skin protein collagen from yeast via fermentation. Collagen is the main
  material that makes up leather after every other component of the animal hide
  is discarded. By focussing on producing collagen directly, Modern Meadow
  offers a move sustainable way to produce leather that avoids the waste
  conventional leather production is associated with.
