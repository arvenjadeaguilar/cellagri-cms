  Meatable is a new startup that uses cellular agriculture to grow cell-based
  meat. Founded by Krijn de Nood, Daan Luining, and Ruud Out, Meatable is based
  in Leiden, Netherlands. Interestingly, Luining has been involved with cellular
  agriculture from the very beginning by being part of Dr. Mark Postâ€™s research
  team that developed the first cultured meat burger in August 2013. Meatable is
  different from other startups due to their proprietary technique in using
  induced pluripotent stem cells to produce their meat.
