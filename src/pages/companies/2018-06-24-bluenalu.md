  BlueNalu is a new startup that uses cellular agriculture to grow cultured
  meat. Founded by Lou Cooperhouse, Chris Dammann, and Chris Somogyi, BlueNalu
  dubs itself as the first cellular aquaculture company, because they focus on
  creating a sustainable source of seafood from cell cultures and a proprietary
  process for product commercialization. They are currently exploring and
  developing protocols for finned fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.
