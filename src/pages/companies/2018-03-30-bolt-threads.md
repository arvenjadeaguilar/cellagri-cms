  Bolt Threads is a clothing company that uses cellular agriculture to make
  animal-free spider silk. Bolt Threads was founded by Dan Widmaier, David
  Breslauer, and Ethan Mirsk in 2009, and they use yeast cells to produce real
  spider silk via fermentation. Bolt Threads has already released several
  products in the market, including a spider silk tie and a silk toque (in
  partnership with the Best Made Company).
