The **Senior Scientist** will be part of our Cellular Agriculture R&D team that is transforming the future of meat & seafood from todayâ€™s degrading system to one of sustainable, clean meat. As part of our 50+ person R&D department, the Cellular Agriculture team includes stem cell biologists, tissue engineers, process engineers, food scientists and research chefs. This role will be involved in the full spectrum of projects within the Cellular Agriculture team and also interact with other cross functional teams to drive project success. The role will focus on novel methods of applying advanced molecular biology and cell culture techniques to address cell line proliferation, growth characteristics, lineage specification, and terminal differentiation.

 

**You Will:**

\- Isolate and characterize unique animal cell lines used for the production of clean meat

\- Develop methods to differentiate various animal cell types to desired target tissues (e.g., muscle, adipose, etc.) and establish methods to validate them

\- Build understanding and optimization of cell line growth and metabolics utilizing genome editing techniques  (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9)

\- Develop scalable differentiation procedures

\- Apply biochemical and immunological methods to characterize cell populations

\- Thoroughly document experimental results in laboratory notebook and written reports

\- Write and revise Standard Operating Procedures; train other team members as needed

\- Attend, participate in and present at relevant research group meetings

\- Help direct and manage research associate activities



**You Have:**

\- Ph.D. in molecular biology, biology, cell biology, chemical engineering or a closely related field

\- 3-5 years of hands on animal cell culture and molecular biology laboratory experience; may be a combination of academia/industry experience with preference for industry experience

\- Proficiency with animal cell culture techniques and broad set of cell biology techniques

\- Thorough knowledge of genetic expression systems (mammalian, bacterial, lentiviral)

\- Experience with routine molecular biology methods, including DNA/RNA extraction, plasmid preparation, restriction digestion, mutagenesis, DNA sequencing, RT-PCR and qPCR.

\- Experience in genome editing platforms such as CRISPR/Cas9

\- History of successfully achieving scientific results in a laboratory setting

\- Ability to communicate effectively across diverse technical areas

\- Strong critical thinking, time management and organizational skills

\- Attention to detail and ability to maintain accurate records
