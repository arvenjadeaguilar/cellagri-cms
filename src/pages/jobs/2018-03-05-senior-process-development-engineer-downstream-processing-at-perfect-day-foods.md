Perfect Day is close to commercializing its first animal-free dairy protein products and we are seeking an **experienced process engineer** capable of managing a broad range of research activities in order to successfully scale the production processes from the laboratory and pilot plant into commercial facilities. The ideal candidate will be driven and will do what it takes to make a contribution to a small team in a fast paced start-up environment.

**Role and Responsibilities:**

\- Identify, develop and implement novel downstream technologies to deliver on protein product amount, purity and recovery yield targets for toxicology testing, customer samples and commercial production.

\- Lead, design and execute DSP optimization experiments in conjunction with other staff to deliver anefficient, cost effective technology package for scale up through to product commercialization.

\- Develop the process design basis (sizing, selection and/or retrofit of equipment, mass balance and instrument control), establish scale-up/scale-down parameters using engineering fundamentals and cooperatively work to develop and optimize process control strategies for downstream purification.

\- Evaluate compatibility of potential contract manufacturing facilities with the DSP process requirements, and support manufacturing technology transfer to troubleshoot and ensure process performance at scale.

\- Develop and mentor DSP team members to maximize their contribution and meet corporate objectives.



**Requirements:**

\- MS or PhD in Chemical or Biochemical Engineering or related discipline with a minimum of 5 years direct experience in downstream processing / purification technology, process design and scale-up.

\- Expertise with one or more unit operations typically used in biotechnology downstream processing / purification and spray drying. Experience with equipment start-up and validation is a plus.

\- Self-starter with good organizational skills; able to work in cross-functional teams, provide strong analytic and process design skills, root cause analysis, training and general communication.

\- Proficient in structured methodologies used in industrial process design and control.

\- Project management training and process modelling software experience are an advantage.

\- Ability to stand or sit for prolonged periods, climb, kneel, bend, and at times lift objects as heavy as 50 lbs.

\- Some travel will be required.



**Work Environment:**

\- Position is located in a mix of typical laboratory, workshop and kitchen environments, and requires a tolerance for high worker traffic, close quarters, noise, odors, dust, transiently wet and dirty floors, and varying room temperatures and lighting.
