GFI’s **Foundation Relations Manager** will inspire the generosity of our supporters by developing a robust and vibrant foundation grants program. By securing philanthropic grants, and creating and sustaining strong, long-term relationships with grantors, your work will directly impact how quickly we can transform the global food system with the latest innovations in plant-based and “clean” meat, eggs, and dairy.

**How You Will Make a Difference:**

GFI is 100% supported by philanthropy, and we have only scratched the surface of our fundraising potential. As our Foundation Relations Manager, you will be responsible for building a grants program that will fuel our work to transform animal agriculture, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve natural resources, and prevent animal suffering on a massive scale by:

\- Leading all aspects of GFI’s grant-seeking program: drafting compelling cases for support, grant requests, acknowledgement correspondence, and progress reports.

\- Researching philanthropic grant funding opportunities, both for general support of GFI’s mission and for program-specific funding opportunities.

\- Creating and maintaining a detailed annual grant-seeking calendar, documenting all deadlines for LOIs, proposals, and progress reports.

\- Building strong, meaningful, long-term relationships with our foundation grantors to maintain and expand their continued support while constantly growing the circle of prospective funders.

\- Preparing and submitting funding proposals and stewardship reports, working closely with program staff as needed.

**Who We're Looking For:**

We are seeking smart, thoughtful, and creative self-starters who want to push back against climate change, transform industrialized animal agriculture, and develop healthy and humane foods that are accessible to everyone. GFI staff enjoy high levels of autonomy and must be self-motivated, work well both independently and in concert with a larger group, and be comfortable working with a rapidly evolving and growing team.

This Foundation Relations Manager must also have:

\- A bachelor's degree.

\- A minimum of five years of previous development experience, including two years working in a foundations relations/grant-seeking capacity or equivalent work with leadership donors

\- Significant experience writing compelling fundraising proposals and progress reports. 

\- An outgoing and friendly personality.

\- Excellent written and verbal communication skills.

\- The capacity to work independently and effectively under the pressure of constant deadlines.

\- The willingness to travel occasionally, including on evenings and weekends.

\- Enthusiasm for GFI’s mission.

\- Adherence to a plant-based lifestyle.
