**We’re Looking For...**

The **Special Projects** team at Bolt Threads is aimed at amplifying the reach, potential and creative uses of our biomaterials platform. Our work ranges from new means of production, compelling prototype fabrication and consumer product development that demonstrate the unique properties of our materials. A successful candidate comes with a broad range of skills that cross domains like mechanical and electrical engineering, consumer product development, design, soft goods, digital and hands-on fabrication and great communication skills.  This role is ideally suited for someone who thrives on intellectual challenges, collaborating with an equally curious team, and paving new ground through hands-on experimentation.

**You’ll be Excited to Come to Work Because…**

_The Experience_

\- You’ll have the ability to make a significant, positive impact on a team, a company, and the world.
