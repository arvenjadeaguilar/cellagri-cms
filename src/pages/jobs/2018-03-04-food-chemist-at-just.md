At JUST our mission is to bring healthier, more affordable food to everyone, everywhere. We developed a technology platform that enables us to examine plants from different corner of the planet in the search for better, healthier, and more sustainable food ingredients. You are a **food or materials scientist or chemist** with strong basic and applied research experience. You tackle problems hands-on, arriving at solutions to complex problems by relating food functionality to first principles of physics and chemistry. You are keen on applying research to discover how novel, sustainable ingredients can be used to enable entire categories of delicious food products to be made.   

At JUST, Inc.  you will be responsible for designing and implementing methods for assaying simplified food systems to test novel ingredient contributions and interactions. In this role, you will be the critical link connecting our research team discovering novel ingredients to process engineers who will produce these materials at a commercial scale and product developers who create delicious, transformational products with the ingredients you help identify and characterize. Come join us and together we will create the future of food.  



**You Will:**

\- Conceive and develop assays to measure physicochemical properties of novel food ingredients

\- Drive data interpretation providing insights into materials, formulation, and process factors driving sensory results.

\- Work closely with automation engineers to adapt assays to be implemented on our high throughput material screening platform

\- Validate preliminary characterization of novel ingredients performed by our Discovery group in model systems that are more representative of complete food matrices.

\- Accelerate our product development pipeline by enabling our product developers with a deep understanding of how each novel ingredient performs in relevant experimental landscapes. 

\- Design and implement food model systems that allow for the understanding of how individual components contribute to overall system attributes such as texture, flavor, and stability.

\- Collaborate with cross-functional teams of scientists, statisticians and culinary experts in a way to leverage each unique skillset the JUST team brings together. 

\- Perform research with the following subset of analytical techniques: solid-state DSC, UV/VIS-spectroscopy, DLS, laser diffraction particle size analysis, rheology, texture profile analysis, microscopy, contact angle goniometry.



**You Have:**

\- MS or PhD in Food Science, Biophysics, Chemistry, Material Science or relevant Engineering discipline, ideally with 3+ years of industry experience.

\- Solid background in food chemistry with specific emphasis on the properties of proteins, fats, starches, and their interactions.

\- Deep knowledge of molecular, chemical, and physical aspects of food-related properties.

\- Experience in product development is a plus.

\- Demonstrated experience in experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation.

\- Personal attributes include being adaptive, resourceful, self-motivated, curious, independent, and thrive in a collaborative and fast-paced environment.

\- Excellent communication and interpersonal skills; must be a team player.

\- Ability to master new research techniques quickly. 

\- Prior exposure to a scientific programming language such as R or Python is a plus.
