The **engineering team** at Bolt Threads is looking for an accomplished **mechanic or technician** to help us provide creative engineering solutions to a wide variety of projects. The best person for us has a broad range of experience working with and/or supporting engineering teams with a wide range of skills including mechanical and electrical. 

They will work with a team skilled in design, fabrication, and implementation of highly custom and complex engineering solutions. 

We are a customer focused group, so a strong desire to partner with other teams at Bolt to help them realize their engineering needs is crucial. The role is ideal for someone looking to “level-up” and has a number of opportunities to grow skills in custom design, fabrication, assembly and equipment support.

If you are the person in your world that people seek out to make things happen, we’d love to hear from you.

\- You will perform basic electrical wiring for low voltage and line voltage systems (can use screw terminals, harness wires, wire a plug)

\- You will help design and implement engineering controls to improve operator safety in a laboratory or manufacturing environment

\- You are excited to collaborate directly with our scientists and process and product engineering teams to help them achieve their goals

\- You will be an ambassador for the engineering team and will be seen as an ally to customers



**This Team will be Excited to Have You Because You Bring:**

\- At least 5 years in an engineering mechanic or technician role

\- A safety mindset at all times. Experience in hazard and risk assessment and the ability to work with company EHS and facilities to help enable a continuous improvement in safety culture

\- Familiarity with, or ability to learn other machining techniques (Mill/Lathe) is a plus

\- Familiar with fasteners, pipe and tubing, valves and other fittings

\- Knowledgeable with fabrication materials and their compatibility with chemistries and other conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.).

\- Ability to read a mechanical drawing, layout parts and make accurate measurements

\- Great documentation and record-keeping skills

\- A good mix of right-brained creativity with left-brained execution skills

\- Familiarity with biotech/process development environment is a big plus

\- The ability to lift a 50 lbs
