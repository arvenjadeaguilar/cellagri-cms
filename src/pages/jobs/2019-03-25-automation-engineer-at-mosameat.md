We are looking for a hands-on **engineer** to build and program tools and machines that will replace animals in meat production. Culturing meat (ie growing real meat from animal cells) is still a labour-intensive and expensive endeavour. As an engineer in our new automation team, you will help optimise the production process by developing tools, software and robotics. 

**What you can achieve:**

\- Making cultured meat a success by sharing your creativity and expertise in our team

\- Develop and build unique concepts and technologies for a revolutionising industry

\- Work on a wide range of technologies: Robotics, liquid handling, process monitoring, data analysis

\- Learn all about cell culture and biotechnology as you will work closely with the other R&D teams

**What we're looking for:**

\- Able to program microcontrollers (Arduino/Raspberry Pi etc) for reading sensory output and control actuators 

\- Able to build software tools and UI's

\- Able to design and assemble electronic circuits

\- Able to build and test functional prototypes

\- "Can do" attitude and passion for the mission

\- Able to work quickly, be highly resourceful, and take initiative to fill in gaps in your knowledge

\- Experience working with sterile environments a plus 

\- Experience with bio- or food technology a plus

\- Bachelor degree or vocational training (for us, your formal qualifications are not the most important thing. What we're really looking for is your expertise, creativity and drive!)

**What you can expect from us**

We are a small team working on an innovation that we believe will have a huge global impact. _As a part of this exciting project, we promise that you will get to_:

\- Collaborate with a friendly, international team of world-class scientists and engineers in an all-hands-on-deck start-up environment

\- Enjoy an enterprising environment with lots of freedom in your projects 

\- Combine science with a commercial goal

\- Enjoy 25 days of paid leave per year

\- Work in the beautiful, historical city of Maastricht
