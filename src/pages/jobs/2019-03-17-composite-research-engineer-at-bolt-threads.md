Bolt Threads is looking for an experienced **composite research engineer/scientist** to support the development of novel material using Bolt’s unique biomaterials. The ideal candidate will have strong technical fundamentals, practical experience in the design and execution of experiments, as well as a thorough knowledge of composite design, sample fabrication and characterization. This position will play a key role in a multidisciplinary research team working to develop novel natural fiber-reinforced composites.

**You’ll be Excited to Come to Work Because…**

**The Experience**

\- You’ll have the ability to make a significant, positive impact on a team, a company, and the world.

\- You’ll get honest feedback that’s given in the service of helping us get better at what we do.

\- You’ll encounter unique (often ambiguous) challenges, and diverse teams working to solve them.

\- You’ll find innovative approaches to science, technology, and culture.



**The Work**

> _Within the first 30 days, you will…_



\- Learn established standard operating procedures (SOP’s) for flexible composite fabrication and characterization.

\- Formulate and fabricate fiber-reinforced composites with varying properties from various biomaterials.

\- Investigate root causes of product failures.

\- Design and execute experiments, analyze data, and present the conclusions to the project teams.

\- Use Benchling to register result data and established analysis tools to interpret the results.

\- Engage with EHS to perform job hazard assessment (JHA) for new processes.



> _Within the first 60 days, you will…_

\- Own the development of methods for composite mechanical testing and characterization.

\- Design natural fiber-reinforced composites with improved mechanical properties for soft goods and structural applications.

\- Consult with the product development team to ensure that products meet specifications.

\- Analyze and interpret the results from most of the laboratory instruments.

\- Author SOPs and technical reports for several stakeholders.

\- Present results and conclusions to stakeholders across several functional areas.

\- Establish relationships between the structure and properties of the natural fiber composites made at Bolt Threads.



**This Team will be Excited to Have You Because You Bring…**

\- MS or Ph.D. degree in a relevant discipline (e.g. Composites engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Textiles Engineering, Polymer Chemistry, Biomaterials).

\- 3+ years of experience in fiber-reinforced composite design (e.g. laminate fabrication, fiber placement, bonded assemblies) and manufacturing methods (e.g. bag molding, compression molding).

\- Up to date knowledge of the relevant literature regarding composites and material sciences including resin systems.

\- Good organization skills time management, written and oral communication skills.

\- Materials mechanical and thermal characterization experience.

\- Computer-aided design (e.g. Solidworks, Fusion 360) and CNC machining experience.

\- Experience developing composites using natural fibers (e.g. silk, cotton) and non-petroleum based resins is highly favorable.

\- Knowledge of a programing language (e.g. Python, Octave) is favorable.
