A strategic and energetic leader to help us build revenue-driving partnerships and businesses leveraging our proprietary materials platform. The ideal candidate is a team player and strong communicator first and foremost. He or she is also experienced at evaluating market opportunities and building new businesses and partnerships, either as an entrepreneur or in a new business development role within a larger organization. Prior experience with premium lifestyle brands in apparel, footwear and accessories is a must.

Thriving at Bolt requires a blend of right and left brain, with an emphasis on both strategic creativity as well as analytical decision-making. Building strong relationships, both internally and externally, is critical to success, as is strategic decision-making and business judgment. A background in science and technology is not necessary; rather, it’s important to be curious and unafraid to dig deeply into a technology to learn how to position it in the marketplace. The core responsibilities of the role will be to 1) oversee Bolt’s existing portfolio of apparel and footwear partners; 2)  evaluate new consumer markets and partners and 3) help develop new direct-to-consumer strategic partnerships built on Bolt materials.
