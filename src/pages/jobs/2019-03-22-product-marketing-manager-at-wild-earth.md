For the launch of our line of full dog food, we are looking for a **product marketing manager** with pet food experience. As the product marketing manager, you are responsible for making our products “fly-off the shelf.” This role is the glue that binds our product strategy to the tactics we need to drive success in sales and marketing and to achieve results. You will be the product evangelist and will play an integral role in organizing product launches.

You know our competitors like the back of your hand: what they do today and what they plan to do in the future. You also know our customers better than they know themselves, including how they make their buying decisions. This isn’t guesswork. You back up strategic insights with market evidence and then use that knowledge to drive the development of positioning and messaging that resonates with buyers and empowers our sales channels to be successful.

You will collaborate with our sales team to develop innovative programs that drive demand. An attention to detail and eye for quality are critical to your success, along with an ability to grasp and present our product’s value proposition in a way that resonates and clearly articulates how we solve our customers’ problems. You are obsessed with tracking performance, and have the data to prove what’s working and what isn’t.

## Key Responsibilities

\- Market intelligence - be the expert on our customers, who are they, how they buy and their key buying criteria.

\- Understand the competitive landscape - be an expert on our competition and how they are positioned.

\- Collaborate with product management and marketing communications to develop product positioning and messaging that resonate with our target buyer personas.

\- Understand and document our customers process, including where they get information, and the who, what, when and why behind the decisions they make. Then drive changes to our sales and marketing processes based on what you learn.

\- Develop a marketing plan for the products you support in conjunction with our marketing team, including key activities and budgets to support the retention of existing customers and the acquisition of new customers.

\- Assess the effectiveness of the marketing programs that support your products on an ongoing basis, and report back to the business on required changes.

\- Plan the launches of net-new products and releases of existing products, and manage the cross-functional implementation of the plan.

\- Understand and support our sales channels; train them on the problems we solve for our customers and buyers; develop internal tools and external collateral and teach them how and when to use it.
