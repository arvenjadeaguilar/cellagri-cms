The **R&D Scientist (Media development)** will be responsible for developing and running experimental designs to develop cell culture media formulations. The R&D Scientist will also analyze and interpret data to make recommendations regarding the path forward.

**Duties include:**

\- Mammalian and avian cell/tissue culture techniques including thawing, subculturing, freezing, and single cell cloning

\- Mammalian cell culture media development (serum free/chemically defined)

\- Designs and executes experiments and execution done independently or with guidance from team/project lead for complex experiments.  

\- Proficient data interpretation and takes an active role in determining next steps alongside the project team/lead. 

\- Plans further experiments based on data and objectives

\- Works across traditional and high throughput cell culture platforms at multiple scales

\- Develops new procedures for relevant areas

  



**About You:**

\- BS or MS  in cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, bioengineering or closely related science with 5+ years of post-graduate research and development experience in the biopharmaceutical or similar industry 

\- Desired: Ph.D. with 2+ years of post-graduate research and development experience in the biopharmaceutical or similar industry 

\- Working knowledge or hands-on experience of primary and stem cell culture processes 

\- Competent with Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and statistical software like JMP, Minitab, Simca, etc.

\- Strong written and oral communication skills

\- Comfortable working in a fast-paced and cross-functional environment

\- Comfortable developing scientific knowledge base by learning new methods from peers, seminars and scientific literature.

\- Fosters a team environment collaborating scientifically with direct team members as well as scientists in other departments. Open to new ideas and often seeks critical feedback from colleagues and demonstrates effective cooperation.

\- Maintains laboratory notebooks with detailed experimental designs and results. 

\- Prepares written project reports and presents oral updates/summaries at team meetings. 



**Desirable skills/experience:**

\- Working knowledge of statistical design of experiment techniques (DOE)

\- Mammalian and/or avian cell culture and recombinant protein expression. e.g.  generation of stable cell lines expressing relevant levels of a r-protein

\- Experience with protein analysis methods (i.e, Western blot, FACS and immunocytochemistry)

\- Standard molecular biology techniques including molecular cloning, transfection, genomic and plasmid DNA purification, RNA isolation, PCR and RT-PCR/ddPCR and the ability to design basic and engineered recombinant protein expression constructs
