We're looking to expand the team with a **postdoctoral fellow** versed in **skeletal muscle cell biology** (initially for a one-year project). The objective of the project is to create muscle organoids of sufficient maturity to serve as substrate for consumable meat.

The responsibilities of the postdoctoral fellow will include cell and tissue culture of skeletal muscle organoids towards functional, morphological and proteomic optimisation. Strategies towards optimisation include cell selection, cell (co)culture, cell-biomaterial interaction and maturation approaches. The project will be carried out in a team with PhD student(s) and technician(s), supervised by our CSO Mark Post or by a senior investigator.

For these tasks we are looking for a biological/biomedical researcher at postdoctoral level with knowledge and experience in skeletal muscle cell biology in in vitro settings. As the project involves product development, you need to be comfortable with applied research in a mixed academic/company environment. We especially seek a candidate who is passionate about bringing clean meat to market, and who will approach our mission with enthusiasm, dedication and creativity.

The project and position are initially for one year but with excellent prospects of extension to three years.

We offer competitive remuneration and a friendly, collaborative working atmosphere.
