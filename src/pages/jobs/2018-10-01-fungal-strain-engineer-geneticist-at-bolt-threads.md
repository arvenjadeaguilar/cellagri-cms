Bolt Threads is looking for a creative **Fungal Strain Engineer** to help push the frontier of what can be achieved with materials derived from fungal biomass. You’ve worked in different labs with different species, and your robust experience manipulating fungal genomes and studying fungal physiology provide a platform for exploring new phenotypes. Since this is uncharted territory, you’re excited to tackle challenges fraught with uncertainty. You’ll work with the Biology team to build out Bolt’s capabilities to alter and characterize fungal strains, and will collaborate with Bolt’s material characterization experts to understand how strain changes translate to novel material behaviors. Your enthusiasm for developing sustainable alternatives to (and improvements upon) incumbent materials will fuel your search for innovative ideas and solutions.

**You’ll be Excited to Come to Work Because…**

_The Experience:_

\- You’ll have the ability to make a significant, positive impact on a team, a company, and the world.

\- You’ll get honest feedback that’s given in the service of helping us get better at what we do.

\- You’ll encounter unique (often ambiguous) challenges, and diverse teams working to solve them

\- You’ll find innovative approaches to science, technology, and culture.



_The Work:_

\- You will develop the infrastructure, tools, and protocols for handling and genetically manipulating diverse fungal species (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes).

\- You will explore the influence of media/substrate, genotype, and environmental conditions on growth.

\- You will identify key growth phenotypes, and develop appropriate assays for measuring them.

\- You will make targeted and random genetic perturbations to improve desired phenotypes.

\- You will work safely at all times, report any issues, and coordinate with the group and EH&S to ensure a safe work environment.



**This Team will be Excited to Have You Because You Bring...**

\- PhD in biology, microbiology, genetics, mycology, or related field

\- Experience making targeted genetic changes in multiple fungal species (exposure to both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes a plus)

\- Experience with fungal growth characterization (microscopy of hyphae; colony morphology); specific experience with cell wall composition, hyphae fusion, and/or cell division a plus.

\- Detailed understanding of basidiomycete development and differentiation a plus

\- Strong quantitative training (statistics/experimental design, data analysis)
