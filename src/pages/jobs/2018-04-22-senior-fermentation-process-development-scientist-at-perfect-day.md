**POSITION:** Full time, exempt

**REQUIRED EDUCATION:** MS/PhD in Biochemical Engineering, Microbiology, or related discipline.

**AREA(S) OF EXPERTISE DESIRED:** Managing the development of microbial fermentation processes, technology transfer, and scale-up to commercial manufacturing.



**Description:**

Perfect Day is working to commercialize its first animal-free dairy protein products. We are seeking a highly skilled and experienced **Senior Fermentation Process Development Scientist** to lead and manage a broad range of research and development activities to successfully develop, optimize and scale the fermentation process from the laboratory through pilot plant into commercial facilities. The ideal candidate will have strong interpersonal skills and be driven to do what it takes to contribute to a small cross-functional team in a fast paced, collaborative, start-up environmen

**Role and Responsibilities:**

\- Lead or participate in multidisciplinary teams addressing critical issues in fermentation. Help set and execute the strategic and tactical direction in upstream process development and related technologies.

\- Lead, design and execute optimization experiments and related projects in conjunction with other staff to deliver anefficient, cost effective technology package for scale up through to product commercialization.

\- Identify, develop and implement novel upstream technologies required to meet project objectives with respect to protein production rate, titer, yield and purity, and to deliver material for toxicology testing, customer samples and commercial production.

\- Develop and mentor team members to maximize their contribution and meet corporate objectives.

\- Participate in project team responsible for executing successful technology transfer and scale-up of fermentation and recovery processes to contract development and manufacturing partners
