A hands-on **Bioprocess Chemist/Scientist** to support the development of our silk protein purification process for commercial manufacturing. The ideal candidate will have strong technical fundamentals in biochemical techniques, particularly applied to industrial protein purification and practical experience in the design and execution of experiments. The candidate should have experience in scaled down protein purification targeted towards developing large scale processes. This ‘Recovery and Separations’ position will play a key role in communicating with multiple groups upstream (biology, fermentation) and downstream (analytical, fiber spinning, material properties). Anyone who enjoys critically thinking through process development while collaborating with members within and outside the team will thrive in this role.



**You’ll be Excited to Come to Work Because…**

_The Experience:_

\- You’ll have the ability to make a significant, positive impact on a team, a company, and the world.

\- You’ll get honest feedback that’s given in the service of helping us get better at what we do.

\- You’ll encounter unique (often ambiguous) challenges, and diverse teams working to solve them

\- You’ll find innovative approaches to science, technology, and culture.



_The Work:_

\- Design and execute bench scale / scale down protein purification experiments. Develop and apply biochemical quantitative and qualitative assays to bioseparation processes.

\- Design and quantitatively evaluate streamlined multi-step purification protocols for the extraction, isolation and characterization of target proteins from fermentation broth, such as complex mixtures of salts, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates.

\- Develop separation of proteins based on diverse characteristics such as size, charge, stability, phase partitioning and binding affinity.

\- Develop chromatographic purification strategies of intracellular and extracellular protein recovery from different microbial hosts.

\- Analyze mass balance and engineering data towards understanding of large scale process development.

\- Analyze, document and communicate experiment results and processes through regular team meeting presentations.

\- Improve existing bench-scale purification processes and develop new bench-scale processes for existing and novel target proteins.

\- Support the manufacturing team and pilot plant as necessary in tech transfer, commissioning, process stabilization, troubleshooting, and optimization.

\- Work safely at all times.



**This Team will be Excited to Have You Because You Bring... **

\- PhD (2 years of industry experience desired) / (MS/BS with minimum 5 of industry experience) in Chemistry, Biochemistry, Chemical Engineering or related field. Industrial experience in protein purification highly desired.

\- Fundamental and applied knowledge of protein purification spanning column chromatography, cell disruption, extraction, precipitation, centrifugation and membrane filtrations. Understanding of large scale unit operations is needed.

\- Expertise in bioanalytical methods including SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, protein quantification using spectrophotometry, HPLC and others. Experience with analysis of non-protein species including polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids is an added plus.

\- Excellent written and verbal communication.

\- Hands-on experience and understanding of intra/extra cellular recombinant protein purification.

\- Experience with membrane, structural, amyloid-like, highly hydrophobic or other tricky proteins a plus.
