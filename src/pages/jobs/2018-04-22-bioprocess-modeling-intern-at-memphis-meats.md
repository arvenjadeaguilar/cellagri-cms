As a **BioProcess Engineering Intern**, you will join a team at the forefront of producing clean meat. You will have a chance to share your knowledge and creative thinking with a small team of best-in-class scientists and engineers. You'll learn a lot, work really hard and possibly be part of changing the world. This is a paid, full‐time, temporary position, for 3 months or longer.      



**Responsibilities:**

\- Mathematical modeling and simulation of bioprocesses under the direction of a Memphis Meats lead.

\- Developing a software tool capable of storing and retrieving bioprocess parameters and data associated with experiments.

\- Developing a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to enable Memphis Meats team to select parameter values and experimental data for use in bioprocess simulation.

\- Under the guidance of a Memphis Meats lead, contribute to the adaptation and application of established bioprocess mathematical models to novel applications.

\- Implement analytical and numerical approaches to extract bioprocess model parameters from experimental data.

\- Develop pivot tables and pivot charts to facilitate data summary and visualization.

\- Gain exposure to experimental bioprocessing techniques and contribute to bench work.

\- Documenting experimental work, including the maintenance of an updated and complete laboratory notebook, preparation of a written completion report, and presentation of results to members of the scienﬁc team.

\- Participating in bioprocess engineering research and development teams to provide novel ideas and suggestions for improved design concepts and quanﬁcation metrics.

\- Prepare a training document and train Memphis Meats team members on use of the bioprocess modeling software tool.

\- Prepare and share presentation for the team at the end of the summer on key learnings.



**About you:**

\- Strong desire to change the world, innovative, believes that we > I, love to learn

\- Enrolled in a biological, chemical, or mechanical engineering BS program (or related)

\- At least one year of computer programming and/or modeling experience, preferably in biological, chemical, or mechanical engineering applications

\- Proficiency in Microsoft Excel VBA programming and Matlab

\- Experience with maintaining a lab notebook.
