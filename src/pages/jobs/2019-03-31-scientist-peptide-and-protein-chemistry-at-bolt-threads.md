Bolt Threads is looking for an experienced **peptide/protein chemist** to support the development of novel biomaterials. The ideal candidate will have strong technical fundamentals, practical experience in the design and execution of experiments, as well as a thorough knowledge of peptide chemistry, protein structure, and biomolecule characterization. You are excited about the prospect of bringing novel, sustainable, bio-based materials into the world. This position will play a key role in a multidisciplinary research team working to develop biomaterials for fiber and other applications.

 

**You’ll be Excited to Come to Work Because…**

**The Experience**

\- You’ll have the ability to make a significant, positive impact on a team, a company, and the world.

\- You’ll get honest feedback that’s given in the service of helping us get better at what we do.

\- You’ll encounter unique (often ambiguous) challenges, and diverse teams working to solve them.

\- You’ll find innovative approaches to science, technology, and culture.



**The Work**

> _Within the first 30 days, you will…_

\- Learn about Bolt’s different biomaterials, including their composition and production processes.

\- Form working relationships with other chemists, biologists, materials scientists, and product developers to better understand our proteins, processes, and product needs.

\- Design and execute experiments, analyze data, and present results and conclusions in formal written technical reports and verbal presentations.

\- Work safely at all times while promoting the company’s safety culture.



> _Within the first 60 days, you will…_

\- Drive the development and execution of a peptide-based assay for predicting fiber spinning properties.

\- Identify opportunities to improve protein-based product properties through chemical modification or functionalization at any stage in the design and production process.

\- Devise methods to probe and predict protein behavior using peptide-based assays.



 

**This Team will be Excited to Have You Because You Bring...**

\- Degree in a relevant discipline (e.g. Chemistry, Biochemistry, Bioengineering, Polymer Chemistry), PhD or MS with 5+ years of experience

\- Experience in peptide design, modification, and fabrication

\- Experience in peptide characterization and assay development

\- Experience with any/all of the following a plus:

\- Synthetic organic chemistry

\- Unnatural amino acids in peptides and/or proteins

\- Synthesizing peptides that are large (>80 amino acids), hydrophobic, and/or repetitive.

\- Secondary structure analysis; structural proteins

\- Amyloidogenic peptides

\- In silico analysis of peptide properties

\- Strong organizational and time management skills

\- Strong written and oral communication skills

\- Working knowledge of a programming and/or analysis language (e.g. Python, R, JMP) is preferred.

\- Commitment and ability to work safely in a laboratory environment.
