At JUST, Inc. our mission is to bring healthier, more affordable food to everyone, everywhere. We developed a technology platform that enables us to examine plants from different corners of the planet in search for better, healthier, and more sustainable food ingredients. You are a key member of our **Food Science team** that tackles problems hands-on, arriving at solutions to complex problems by relating food functionality to first principles of physics and chemistry. You are keen on applying research to discover how novel, sustainable ingredients can be used to enable entire categories of delicious food products to be made.

At JUST, Inc. you will work with our lead researchers to analyze functional properties and ingredient interactions of new plant materials. Your primary focus will be to perform range of experiments using our assays to characterize physicochemical properties of lead plant proteins in simplified food systems. Come join us and together we will create the future of food. Execute systematic experiments to characterize novel ingredients that are passed on from our Discovery group in food model systems that are more representative of complex food matrices.



**In this role your will:**

\- Analyze functional properties and share learnings with our product developers of how each novel ingredient performs in relevant experimental landscapes

\- Conduct experiments and interpret data from the following subset of analytical techniques but not limited to: rheology, texture profile analysis, solid-state DSC, DLS, laser diffraction particle size analysis, CLSM microscopy, contact angle goniometry.

\- Design, coordinate and conduct sensory studies with both trained and untrained panelists.

\- Document all experimental procedures and data such that it can be easily and efficiently analyzed.

\- Present work progress and data updates at lab meetings

\- Collaborate with cross-functional teams of scientists, statisticians and culinary experts in a way to leverage each unique skillset the JUST team brings together.



**Requirements:**

\- Bachelors or M.S. in Food Science or related discipline with 0 - 2 years experience

\- Hands on experience working in a lab and familiarity with food product development

\- Solid background in food science fundamentals

\- Demonstrated experience in experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation.

\- Attention to detail and record keeping

\- Adherence to lab safety procedures

\- Personal attributes include being adaptive, self-motivated, organized, curious, independent, and thrive in a collaborative and fast-paced environment.

\- Excellent communication and interpersonal skills; must be a team player.
