Desired candidate should be a self-starter with a strong general business skillset, have the ability to quickly get up to speed on our business and the relevant technical details, and be willing to help out with any task thrown at them. 



The candidate will report to **Clara’s** CEO and will focus primarily on supporting Clara’s go-to-market efforts for its first product launch and defining its high-level strategy over the next several years. This will likely include supporting presentations to external stakeholders (e.g. investors or the Board), supporting Clara’s leadership team as they project manage toward certain milestones, defining Clara’s go-to-market plan as it moves to launch its first product, and conducting financial analyses on unit economics and other aspects of the business. 



This will be a unique opportunity to be a part of a transformative change in the global food system. 



Experience with financial modeling, market analysis, food and beverage space and/or biotech would be a bonus. 



Ideal candidate will have 2+ years of consulting or investment banking experience. Given Clara’s small size and technical nature, the business team at Clara Foods wears a lot of hats. This is a great opportunity to get your hands dirty, and you will not find a lack of interesting projects on which to work!
