The **Senior Policy Specialist **will make that transition possible by supporting policies that ensure that consumers have access to plant-based and clean meat, eggs, and dairy; give investors confidence; and allow innovators to compete in the marketplace.

**How You Will Make a Difference:**

GFI’s Senior Policy Specialist will level the playing field for plant-based and clean meat alternatives in Washington, working closely with GFI staff and other nonprofit organizations on GFI’s legislative and regulatory priorities. You will radically transform the food system by:

\- Drafting legislation and writing letters, comments, policy briefs, and fact sheets to support GFI’s policy priorities.

\- Meeting regularly with congressional staff on USDA, and FDA policy; delivering testimony and remarks on the benefits of plant-based and clean meat; and collaborating with other GFI staff to showcase their expertise via Hill visits and congressional briefings.

\- Cultivating relationships with other nonprofit organizations, including those focused on environmental, global hunger, public health, free speech, and food safety issues, to build alliances and support for the policies that will be most effective in groups focused on increasing plant-based options and readying the path to market for clean meat.

\- Developing a strategy to address emerging threats at the state level.

**Who We’re Looking For:**

We are seeking smart, thoughtful, and creative self-starters who want to push back against climate change, transform industrial animal agriculture, and develop healthy and humane foods that are accessible to everyone. GFI staff enjoy high levels of autonomy and must be self-motivated, work well both independently and in concert with a larger group, and be comfortable working with a rapidly evolving and growing team.

_The Senior Policy Specialist must also have:_

\- A bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience in environmental studies, public health, science, political science, or related field. A J.D., advanced policy degree, or advanced scientific degree is preferred but not required.

\- A minimum of three years’ professional experience in a related field.

\- Experience in and comfort with communicating with high-level congressional or executive branch policymakers and staff.

\- Experience building coalitions and developing consensus among partners with different but complementary objectives.

\- The demonstrated ability to communicate complex information clearly in writing and in oral presentations to a range of audiences.

Nonprofit or lobbying experience is highly preferred. 

This position is remote, but candidates must live in or be willing to relocate to the Washington, D.C. area. Candidates who have experience working with a diverse range of people and who can contribute to the climate of inclusivity are encouraged to identify their experiences in these areas.

Enjoy working from home or a co-working space, full medical coverage, optional dental and vision packages, a 401(k) retirement plan, flexible holiday and vacation plans, room for advancement, respectful managers, and supportive colleagues at The Good Food Institute!
