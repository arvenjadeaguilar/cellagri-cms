Looking for an assistant to start ASAP, preferably communications or science background, fresh out of college. Looking for somebody **inexperienced** (_not a typo_) and motivated to work closely with the executive team and see what it's like to run a startup in its early stages. 

No specific experience required, just looking for a competent and motivated generalist.

The job will involve a lot of grunt work in order to take it off the plate of the executive staff, mostly the CEO. There will also be independent projects and speaking engagements if that is of interest. Preferably this person will also run our social media but the social media is pretty low stakes since we aren't an online business and don't sell product yet. This is not a remote position, the candidate must either be in the bay area already or willing to move here more or less immediately.

Must be currently eligible to work in the US.

Weâ€™re a team of 9 full-time staff, with a solid foundation. 

We are committed to diversity and especially encourage those from underrepresented communities to apply, including but not limited to people of color, LGBTQ community members, people with lived experience in low-income communities, and people with disabilities. If you or somebody you know is motivated to work with a dynamic team of people to change the world's food supply please apply today!
