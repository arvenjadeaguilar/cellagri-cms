The work of GFI’s **Senior Scientists** will expand the frontiers of plant-based and clean meat, egg, and dairy technologies until they render factory farming obsolete.

**How You Will Make a Difference:**

GFI’s **Senior Scientists** develop and promote the science of plant-based and clean meat, egg, and dairy technologies. As the global experts in this sector, they work to ensure that a roadmap exists for plant-based and clean alternatives; that the best scientists are engaged in plant-based and clean meat, egg, and dairy R&D; and that significant funds are directed toward scientific endeavors to transform agriculture away from the industrial farming of animals. Working with key academic, nonprofit, and industry stakeholders, GFI’s Senior Scientists ensure that plant-based and clean alternatives to factory-farmed products dominate the marketplace as quickly as possible by:

\- Leading and writing technical analyses of the plant-based and clean meat, egg, and dairy industries that culminate in white papers, conference presentations, and peer-reviewed articles.

\- Identifying the key areas requiring the most focused research and finding researchers to perform that work.

\- Mobilizing funding by meeting with venture capitalists, foundations, universities, and others that are interested in putting capital into plant-based and clean meat, egg, and dairy technologies.

\- Building GFI’s capacity to serve as a knowledge hub for the industry and to guide public discourse around it.

\- Providing technical support, mentoring, and strategic advice to entrepreneurs, start-ups, venture capitalists, academic faculty, and students on topics such as product development, career changes, business design, and process expertise.

**Who We’re Looking For:**

We are seeking smart, thoughtful, and creative self-starters who want to push back against climate change, transform industrial animal agriculture, and develop healthy and humane foods that are accessible to everyone. GFI staff enjoy high levels of autonomy and must be self-motivated, work well both independently and in concert with a larger group, and be comfortable working with a rapidly evolving and growing team.

We are currently looking for **two Senior Scientists** with distinct and complementary areas of expertise: one to focus primarily on clean meat, eggs, and dairy (with expertise in, e.g., stem cell biology, tissue engineering, biochemical engineering, or synthetic biology); and another to focus primarily on plant-based products (with expertise in, e.g., plant molecular biology, plant genetics, or crop science). Both Senior Scientists must also have:

\- A Ph.D. in a relevant scientific field, or the equivalent (e.g. a master’s degree plus at least five years of experience in R&D in a relevant industry).

\- Exceptional writing.

\- Comfort with public speaking.

\- Experience analyzing scientific literature and conducting literature reviews.

\- A proven track record in translating scientific information into formats for lay professionals.  

\- Functional understanding of the principles, methods, equipment and techniques used in either plant-based or clean meat, egg, and dairy research and manufacturing.



A background in food science or experience working with plant-based or clean meat, egg, or dairy companies is a strong plus.
