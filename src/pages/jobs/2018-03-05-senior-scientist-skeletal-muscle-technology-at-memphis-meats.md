The **Skeletal Muscle Technology** team will lead in the implementation of the skeletal muscle manufacturing program within Memphis Meats. Aims of this program are to establish protocols to increase the percent composition and maturation of the skeletal muscle lineage within our developmental pipeline. This position will focus across skeletal muscle parameters, including, but not limited to, cell characterization, enrichment, proliferation, lineage specification, terminal differentiation and hypertrophy.  To achieve these aims, this role will screen characterized cell populations from target species, develop custom culture media and explore novel culture environments. Once established, this position will facilitate the integration of protocols established into downstream process development. 

  

**Duties Include:**

\- Protocol Design for Cell Purification and Enrichment 

\- Characterization of Cell Populations

\- Comparative Assessment of Cell Performance

\- Development and Optimization of Cultivation Protocols for Process Targets

\- Translating Protocols Across Species

\- Downstream Integration of Validated Protocols

\- Analysis, Compilation and Presentation of Data



**About you:**

\- Relevant Cell Biology Ph.D. With One or More Years of Postdoctoral Experience

\- A Strong Personal Leadership Proficiency Required

\- Demonstrated Expertise in Skeletal Muscle Development and its Effectors

\- Proficiency in a Broad Set of Cell Biology Techniques Such as Flow Cytometry, Magnetic Bead Separation, Proliferation Assays, Protein Assays, Western Blotting, ELISA, Immunostaining, qPCR, and Calcium Imaging
