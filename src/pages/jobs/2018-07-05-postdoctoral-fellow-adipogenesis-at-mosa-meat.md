We are looking to expand the team with a **postdoctoral fellow** versed in **adipogenesis** from stem cells or adipose tissue engineering (initially for a one-year project). The objective of the project is to create fat tissue of sufficient maturity to serve as substrate for consumable meat.

The responsibilities of the postdoctoral fellow will include cell and tissue culture of adipose tissue towards functional, morphological and lipidomic optimisation. Strategies towards optimisation will include cell selection, cell (co)culture, cell-biomaterial interaction and maturation approaches. The project will be carried out in a team with PhD student(s) and technician(s), supervised by our CSO Mark Post or by a senior investigator.

For these tasks we are looking for a biological/biomedical researcher at postdoctoral level with knowledge and experience in adipogenesis and adipocyte cell biology in in vitro settings. The candidate needs to be comfortable with applied research in a mixed academic/company environment. We especially seek a candidate who is passionate about bringing clean meat to market, and who will approach our mission with enthusiasm, dedication and creativity.  

The project and position are initially for one year but with excellent prospects of extension to three years.
