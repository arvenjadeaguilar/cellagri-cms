**How You Will Make a Difference:**

GFI is expanding its work to Europe and is looking for an independent contractor to assist in incorporating a new legal entity and to help lay the groundwork for the expansion of our programs into Europe. Once GFI has established a legal entity in Europe, we will hire an executive director to run the new operations. To ensure a smooth transition and continued operations in Europe, GFI would prefer to hire an independent contractor who will also be interested in applying for the executive director position.

**The independent contractor will complete the following projects:**

\- Establishment of legal entity: Find local attorneys to advise us on the types of legal entities we could establish in Europe (e.g. non-profit or public benefit corporation) and then work with the director of international engagement and the local attorneys to incorporate the legal entity.

\- Memorandum on food regulations: Find and oversee local experts in drafting a memorandum explaining the legal and regulatory framework affecting plant-based and clean meat products in Europe and recommending policy initiatives to advocate for favorable regulations of these products.

\- Databases: Develop databases of key players in the field in the following subject areas:

\- Science: scientists, research institutions, and organizations;

\- Business: plant-based meat, dairy, and egg companies; clean meat, dairy, and egg companies; animal agriculture companies; retailers; distributors; and suppliers;

\- Policy: government entities, government representatives, government innovation or economic development programs; any other government funding programs;

\- Investment and innovation: venture capitalists, incubators and accelerators, and individuals who are interested in investing capital;

\- Development: foundations and individuals interested in donating to GFI or furthering GFI’s mission; and

\- Mission-aligned organizations: organizations working on issues aligned with GFI-Europe’s mission including protecting the environment and animals; advocating for food safety and security; and alleviating hunger, antibiotic resistance, and diseases resulting from the consumption or overconsumption of animal products.

\- Establishing relationships: Work with the director of international engagement to prioritize and establish relationships with key players in science, business, investment, innovation, policy, and development.

\- Advisory council: Identify key players in the country who could advance the interests of GFI in Europe and who may be interested in serving on a European advisory council.

\- Communications: Craft a communications plan to advance GFI’s mission in Europe and assist the director of international engagement in executing the plan.
