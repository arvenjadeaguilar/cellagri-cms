You will discover, motivate, and empower the entrepreneurs who will develop the latest innovations in plant-based and cell-based meat, eggs, and dairy.

As the **Business Innovation Specialist**, it will be _your job_ to build that network by:

\- Presenting dynamic and engaging talks at top universities for business, management, and entrepreneurship (especially those that also have strong food and biotechnology programs) to inspire the next generation of innovators to start or join plant-based and clean food companies.

\- Planning and executing major city events such as panel discussions and conferences to engage large business community audiences interested in plant-based and cell-based meat entrepreneurship and investment.

\- Providing consulting/advisory services to entrepreneurs to help them be successful at starting their companies, including assistance with business plan development and evaluation, communication with investors, and scaling with both suppliers and customers.

\- Collaborating with GFI’s other departments to establish strong networks with technology, policy, and business know-how.
