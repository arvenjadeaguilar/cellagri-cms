GFI’s **Managing Director for Europe** will serve as an independent contractor orchestrating the regional expansion of our efforts to replace factory-farmed products with plant-based and clean meat. By harnessing the power of science and innovation, GFI’s managing director for Europe will help make delicious, healthy, sustainable, and affordable food available to as many people around the world as possible.

**How You Will Make a Difference**

GFI is expanding its work to Europe and is looking for an independent contractor to assist in incorporating a new legal entity and to help lay the groundwork for the expansion of our programs into Europe. Once GFI has established a legal entity in Europe, we will hire an executive director to run the new operations. To ensure a smooth transition and continued operations in Europe, GFI would prefer to hire an independent contractor who will also be interested in applying for the executive director position.

The independent contractor will complete the following projects:

\- Establishment of legal entity: Find local attorneys to advise us on the types of legal entities we could establish in Europe (e.g. non-profit or public benefit corporation) and then work with the director of international engagement and the local attorneys to incorporate the legal entity.

\- Memorandum on food regulations: Find and oversee local experts in drafting a memorandum explaining the legal and regulatory framework affecting plant-based and clean meat products in Europe and recommending policy initiatives to advocate for favorable regulations of these products.

\- Databases: Develop databases of key players in the field in the following subject areas:

\- Science: scientists, research institutions, and organizations;

\- Business: plant-based meat, dairy, and egg companies; clean meat, dairy, and egg companies; animal agriculture companies; retailers; distributors; and suppliers;

\- Policy: government entities, government representatives, government innovation or economic development programs; any other government funding programs;

\- Investment and innovation: venture capitalists, incubators and accelerators, and individuals who are interested in investing capital;

\- Development: foundations and individuals interested in donating to GFI or furthering GFI’s mission; and 

\- Mission-aligned organizations: organizations working on issues aligned with GFI-Europe’s mission including protecting the environment and animals; advocating for food safety and security; and alleviating hunger, antibiotic resistance, and diseases resulting from the consumption or overconsumption of animal products.  

\- Establishing relationships: Work with the director of international engagement to prioritize and establish relationships with key players in science, business, investment, innovation, policy, and development.

\- Advisory council: Identify key players in the country who could advance the interests of GFI in Europe and who may be interested in serving on a European advisory council.

\- Communications: Craft a communications plan to advance GFI’s mission in Europe and assist the director of international engagement in executing the plan.

\- Development: Craft a fundraising plan to hire more staff and advance GFI’s mission in Europe and assist the director of international engagement in executing the plan. 



**Who We’re Looking For**

We are seeking smart, thoughtful, and creative self-starters who want to push back against climate change, transform industrial animal agriculture, and develop healthy and humane foods that are accessible to everyone.

We are considering applicants with:

\- Willingness and ability to work as an independent contractor.
